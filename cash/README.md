The default currency is the US Dollar, if you want to convert it juste run the following command :
> node index.js XX , XX is the amount of US Dollar you want to convert.

Now if you want to convert any currency just add its abreviation after the amount,
for example, if you want to convert 10 euros run : "node index.js 10 EUR "

You can find all the currencies abreviation in the currencies.json file (in cash/lib )

That's all, now you can easily convert any kind of currency ! Easy right ?
